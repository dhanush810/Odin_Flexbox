# Odin_Flexbox
This Repository contains and project of an attractive webpage build using HTML and CSS-Flexbox

I am not really sure what to put here so I will just write what I want to remember.

This is a Website Created as an assignment from the Odin project.

The main focus of this assignment is to implement the CSS I learned(Mainly Flexbox) on a project.

I still have no idea where to use flex-wrap and flex-grow,shrink and basis but I will probably learn it from my upcoming projects.
